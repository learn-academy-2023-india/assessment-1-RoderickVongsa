// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
//console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: Output will put indigo to the array and output "5"

// b) Verify and explain: Ran the code through node in terminal and it outputed "5"

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
//console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: Output will count the number of spaces which 11

// b) Verify and explain: The output was 10 and I miscounted the spaces for the output, console.log(inputwordhre.length) is the command that counts each space before the word

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
//console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: This command will read the 4th word which is "o" from the Index
// b) Verify and explain: The command outputted "o" in "Hello World!" 

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
//console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: the output will put out "Ruby" 
// b) Verify and explain: The reason why it came out to "Ruby" because "JavaScript" is the Index which is 0

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
  //console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: It will put both "saturday"&"sunday" in all caps s
// b) Verify and explain:I tried to run the code but got an error in Terminal saying: "TypeError: weekendDays.toUpperCase is not a function"

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
 //console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: typof returns string determining its value with is expected out "number"
// b) Verify and explain: output was number because of .length counting each value individual "subject" in the string as 4
